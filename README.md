# clicky-game
A memory game created as an exercise to learn React.

# App Organization
This app's structure is entirely front end and follows the basic organization the "create-react-app" produces.
## **Public:** 
These include the index file that is directly displayed by the browser and the robots.txt file, which determines which files web robots can access.

## **Source:** 
These are the React files that drive the experience. They include: 
index.js: This is where React is actually rendering the page.
 App.js, and various components used to create the different parts of the page.

# How to use the app
1. Go to https://woaky1.github.io/clicky_game/.
2. Click on a picture of a Pok&#233;mon and earn a point. Click another picture, but if you click on a Pok&#233;mon you've already clicked on, your score goes back to zero and the game starts over.

# Technology used
This app was built primarily with Node and React. Bootstrap was used to help with page layout. The gh-pages node module was used to help to deploy the app to Github pages.

# About Me
I'm a student at Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. This game was created as homework to help me get familiar with using React. My son helped me pick Pok&#233;mon to use in the game and did play-testing.
